# Journal

Use the `journal-writer` subagent to explore the memories and recent code changes, and write some journal entries.
Journal entries should be concise and focused on the most important events, key changes, impacts, and decisions.
Keep journal entries in the `./docs/journals/` directory.

**IMPORTANT:** Invoke "/sk:project-organization" skill to organize the outputs.

## User Interaction (MANDATORY)

This skill MUST follow [Interactive UI Protocol](../../rules/interactive-ui-protocol.md).

**Rules:**
- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for ALL user clarifications/choices
- Never ask via free-text prompts like "Please answer: 1) X? 2) Y?"
- Each question: 2-4 predefined options + auto "Something else"
- Exception: genuine free-form inputs (file paths, custom names, code snippets)

See rule for full specification.
